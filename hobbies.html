            <h1>Hobbies</h1>

            <h2>Movies</h2>
            
            <p>I enjoy watching movies. I'm a fanatic of video production, so many movies out there appeal to me.
                It's very hard for me to choose which ones are my favorites, as I really go into the fictional
                world presented by each movie. However, here is a small list of the most notable movies I have watched.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Minions</h1>
            
            <img src="assets/minions-animation.gif" alt="minions animation">
            
            <p>The Minions movie is a very funny movie. Even though it is a movie for kids, it still appeals to adults as
                there are many funny innuendos targetting adults. Honestly, who can resist the adorable yellow minions?           
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Tourist</h3>
            
            <p>This is a great movie because throughout the span of plot, the viewer perceives Clara Manzoni (Angelina Jolie)
                as a woman that is utilizing the dumb and helpless tourist Frank Tupeto (Johnny Depp) to distract the police from
                capturing her fugitive husband. However, as the movie progresses, we realize that Frank is a willing particpant
                and he is also anything but helpless and dumb. Both actors provide an excellent portrayal of the character's invovled.
            </p>

            <h2>Financing</h2>
            
            <p>I bet many people would not think of financing as a hobby. However, I love money. Financing is the way I handle my
                money, and I definitly enjoy making money. As far as I'm concern, if I enjoy doing it and I do it for free it is a hobby.
                Just to show that I really do enjoy financing, here is a table that could possibly save you money if you are thinking about
                starting a savings account.
